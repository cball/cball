## About Me ðŸ‘‹

I'm Founder & CEO of [Kind Kiosk](https://kindkiosk.com) and Co-Founder & CTO of [Echobind](https://echobind.com). 

Kind Kiosk is a company built to help nonprofits of all sizes elevate in-person donations. 
We offer temporary kiosks for events like galas and conferences, or dedicated kiosks for offices, museums, animal welfare or faith-based organizations.
Our kiosks are shipped fully configured and are offered in full-size, table mount, and handheld options.

Echobind is an agency that builds custom web and mobile apps for companies of all sizes.
We can create your product from start to finish, help untangle a mess you've accidentally built over the years, or just help your team ship a complex feature.

Build something great!


PS. If you're involved in the nonprofit space, check out the [Nonprofit Conference Directory](https://nonprofitconferencedirectory.com) - a site we built to help you figure out the nonprofit conferences you want to attend.
